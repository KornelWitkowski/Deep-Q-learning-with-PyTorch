# Deep-Q-learning-with-PyTorch
The repository includes several reinforcement learning algorithms for discrete action spaces like Dueling DQN, Categorical DQN, Double DQN, and continuous: Soft-Action Critic and Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy. All models are trained with the use of PyTorch. Below are listed examples of episodes played by trained agents. The outcomes are decent but far from ideal and could be improved by tweaking parameters.
